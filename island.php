              <p class="white">Chantry Island is located on Lake Huron, just over a mile Southwest of the Saugeen River, in Southampton, 
                  Ontario. Overlooking the island is a majestic Imperial Lighthouse built in the mid 1800s, accompanied by the Keeperâ€™s 
                  Cottage, and boat house. In 1822, during a hydrographic survey, Captain Henry Bayfield of the Royal Navy, christened the island 
                  and named it after his friend and British Sculptor, Sir Francis Chantry.</p>
